## What is SmoothScroll Mac?

SmoothScroll Mac is a system-wide scrolling enhancement utility designed to bring fluid, natural scrolling behavior to your macOS device. It replaces the default scrolling mechanics with customizable inertial smoothness, making navigation in browsers, documents, and applications feel more responsive and comfortable.

The app works by intercepting scroll events and applying smooth animation curves, reducing jitter and improving readability during long browsing sessions. Whether you are using a trackpad, mouse, or Magic Mouse, SmoothScroll ensures consistent performance across all input devices.

SmoothScroll is optimized for all Mac models, including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and desktop Macs with Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) processors. It runs efficiently in the background without draining system resources and supports macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, and earlier versions.

Key features include adjustable scrolling speed, smoothness level, and per-application settings. It is ideal for developers, designers, and everyday users who want a more polished scrolling experience.
